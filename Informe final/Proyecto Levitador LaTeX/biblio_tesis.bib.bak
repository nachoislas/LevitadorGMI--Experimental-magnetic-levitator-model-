  Abstract                 = {This paper presents steady-state analysis and dynamic modeling of a non-uniform multiphase buck converter. This type of converter architecture has been reported previously in the literature with non-uniform phase design with the utilization of dynamic non-uniform current sharing and phase picking schemes in order to improve the power conversion efficiency over a wide load range. Since this scheme encounters the use of different current and possibly different inductor values for each phase, and/or different input voltages at the input of each phase, the impact on the steady-state and dynamic performance needs to be studied. This paper presents an initial analysis and small modeling study with discussion and experimental verification.},

  Abstract                 = {Current sharing control in multiphase converters is essential for stable and safe operation under variable conditions or applications. It is usually used to maintain equal or desired current sharing between converter phases. In conventional current sharing schemes, this requires the sensing and processing of each phase current through a current sharing/balancing controller, which adds complexity, size and cost to the converter design. In most cases, conventional schemes are usually based on achieving a preset current sharing ratio between phases (usually equal current value among different phases), assuming that the design of phases is known (or symmetric in the case of equal sharing ratio), which may not result in achieving the optimum efficiency. Moreover, the accuracy of achieving the preset current sharing ratio is sensitive to the current sensing accuracy in all phases, which requires careful and tedious calibration of sensing circuitries. Furthermore, when digital controller is used, in order to achieve equal current sharing or desired current distribution among different phases, more analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are required to obtain digital information on equivalent phases' currents. In this paper, theoretical analysis results are presented to derive or prove a sensorless current sharing method. The analysis is further expanded to reveal the boundary conditions that result in not achieving the desired current sharing ratio. For example, it provides the conditions under which certain phases may carry negative current, resulting in overloading the other phases. The presented method is described and verified with experimental results from a proof of concept prototype based on digital controller implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiphase converters have become an attractive alternative for high-current power converters due to their inherent reduction of semiconductor stress. Additionally, total current ripple frequency can be increased and its amplitude decreased by the phases ripple interleaving. These converters require a different number of phases and control specifications depending on the application. A wide range of applications imposes challenging requirements in the control algorithm and its implementation, such as digital platforms and resources optimization. A previous proposal presented a current control algorithm developed to provide a solution to the highly demanding constraints present in high-power applications, where short settling times are required when fast transients in the current reference or the load voltage are present. This work presents the implementation of the above-mentioned algorithm and its optimizations, aimed to obtain a modular and efficient design. The proposed implementation and system scalability are evaluated by means of an experimental setup.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a new digital current sharing method for parallel interleaved dc-dc converters. The difference between sensed inductor current values can cause unequal current distribution in the parallel dc-dc converters even though they are controlled by the same average current mode controller with a common current reference. To overcome this problem, a simple digital current sharing algorithm using input voltage ripple difference is proposed. The digital current sharing algorithm calculates the required current reference adjustment value using only the input ripple voltage difference information. No additional input current sensing circuit is required. The proposed algorithm achieves equal current distribution between phases of the parallel converters with high parameter insensitivity. For the experimental verification, a 500 W two phase interleaved synchronous buck dc-dc converter which charges a 24 V Li-ion battery is implemented.},

The line current harmonic distortion is analyzed to examine the allowable output voltage range while meeting harmonic regulations. The operation and performance of the proposed circuit is verified on a 300 W, universal line experimental prototype with 80 V output. The measured efficiencies remain above 96% down to 20% of full load across the entire universal line range. Even at 10% of full-load condition, the efficiency remains above 94%.

This paper introduces a parameter-independent, sensorless current-sharing algorithm for multiphase power converters based on gradient estimation via low-frequency perturbation of the per-phase duty cycles, thus eliminating the need for current sensing. Measures of only the input and output voltages are required, so the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and communication/interfacing overhead is low.

The second part suggests a model and emphasizes the design specificities of the monolithic ICT. The final design is provided by an optimization routine, checked in the end by different 2-D and 3-D finite-element simulations, both electromagnetic and thermal. The third part describes the construction of the ICT prototype. It is then placed in a test bench that reproduces the conditions of future operations and provides current balance conditions.

This new method consists of the addition of an auxiliary controller into the control loop, besides the current and voltage regulators. The reference-model-based auxiliary controller improves the robustness of the ACC dynamics in buck-derived distributed power systems, preserving loop gain crossover frequency and stability margins over significant changes of the number of connected modules, the load and the line voltage. Moreover, this control scheme shows much better disturbance rejection properties, i.e., closed-loop output impedance and audiosusceptibility, than conventional ACC. From a control theory point of view robust performance is achieved, preserving stability. A multimodule buck prototype has been experimentally tested with different numbers of modules on stream, line, and load conditions, including discontinuous conduction mode. Measurements of the small-signal frequency response of the converter have been carried out, showing the improvement achieved by the proposed control scheme. The empirical large-signal response of the converter under load steps is also shown in order to validate the concept},

  Abstract                 = {Multiphase is an old technique that, nowadays, is widely used in several dc-dc applications such as voltage regulator module and automotive. The number of phases is usually kept relatively low (three or four) in most cases. However, the advantages of multiphase converters (mainly the reduction of input and output filters with its associated increase in maximum control bandwidth) grow with the number of phases in the ideal case. This growth is limited by nonidealities, mainly the tolerances of components (semiconductors and inductors). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effect of tolerances of the inductance on the current ripple. This nonideality causes the loss of two important advantages of multiphase converters, such as very high frequency and very low amplitude current ripple. The use of digital control can help to reduce drastically this problem. A simple algorithm, based on changing the triggering sequence of the phases, allows a big reduction of the impact of this nonideality. Experiments are included in the paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Some of the recent applications in the field of the power supplies use multiphase converters to achieve fast dynamic response, smaller input/output filters, or better packaging. Typically, these converters have several paralleled power stages, with a current loop in each phase and a single voltage loop. The presence of the current loops avoids current imbalance among phases. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in CCM, with a proper design, there is an intrinsic mechanism of self-balance that reduces the current imbalance. Thus, in the buck converter, if natural zero-voltage switching (ZVS) is achieved in both transitions, the instantaneous inductor current compensates partially the different DC currents through the phases. The need for using n current loops will be finally determined by the application but not by the converter itself. Using the buck converter as a base, a multiphase converter has been developed. Several tests have been carried out in the laboratory and the results show clearly that, when the conditions are met, the phase currents are very well balanced even during transient conditions.},

However, this depends on selecting the correct number of phases and the correct phase inductance for a particular application and requirements. In this paper optimizing the number of phases and the phase inductance is considered to maximize the interleaved synchronous rectifiers efficiency over the desired operating range. To do this, the RMS currents and losses in the bus capacitors, the phase inductances and the switching devices as a function of the number of phases and duty cycle are considered. Generic equations are presented and used to predict the RMS currents in the passive components with some non-intuitive results especially concerning the bus capacitors. It is shown in the paper, that the optimum number of phases is dependent on the converter parameters such as the phase inductance and operating requirements. Practical results are presented confirming the synchronous rectifier loss model.},

This paper proposes a novel multidevice interleaved boost converter (MDIBC) that interfaces the fuel cell with the powertrain of hybrid electric vehicles. In this research, a multidevice structure with interleaved control is proposed to reduce the input current ripples, the output voltage ripples, and the size of passive components with high efficiency compared with the other topologies. In addition, low EMI and low stress in the switches are expected. The proposed dc/dc converter is compared to other converter topologies such as conventional boost converter (BC), multidevice boost converter (MDBC), and two-phase interleaved boost converter (IBC) to verify its dynamic performance. Furthermore, a generalized small-signal model is derived for these dc/dc converters, which has not been previously discussed. A digital dual-loop control is designed to achieve the proper regulator for the converters with fast transient response. The dc/dc converter topologies and their controller are designed and investigated by using MATLAB/Simulink. Finally, the proposed converter (MDIBC) is experimentally validated with results obtained from a 30-kW prototype that has been built and tested in our laboratory based on TMS320F2808 DSP. The simulation and experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed converter is more efficient than other dc/dc converter topologies in achieving high performance and reliability for high-power dc/dc converters.},

For the presented technique, the switching period to retain zero-current switching is predicted rather than sampling the current in real time. Moreover, the related turn-ON period is determined by the voltage controller. Therefore, neither zero-current detection nor high-frequency A/D converter for current sampling is required. Moreover, for interleaved topology with master-slave control, a new ON-time compensation technique is proposed to significantly improve the slave inductor-current distortion, and thereby, achieving current sharing control between phases. Experimental results derived from a DSP-based controller are presented for confirmation. The PFC is with 100 Vac/50 Hz input and 400 Vdc output. The power rating is 460 W. Experimental results show that the power factor is higher than 0.98, efficiency is greater than 96%, and the current sharing can be achieved by the proposed ON-time compensation technique.

  Abstract                 = {A simple current sharing control technique for the switching power supply is presented herein, whose basic concept is that the control effort created from the voltage loop is finely tuned by the control effort created from the current sharing loop based on the proposed phase link so as not only to obtain the desired output voltage but also to make the load current distributed among phases as evenly as possible. Such a control method is not only without any current sharing bus as compared with the traditional current sharing methods, but also suitable for multiple phases under the condition that any one phase among multiple phases fails. Moreover, based on phase link, there is no divider used, as compared with the traditional average current method, and hence, the number of logic elements in the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) can be reduced. In this paper, the detailed basic operating principles, together with new mathematical deductions based on the superposition concept, are firstly described, and secondly some experimental results, based on the FPGA to realize the fully digitalized control of the overall system using one-comparator counter-based sampling without any analog-to-digital converter (ADC), are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed control strategy.},

A comparative study of insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) devices is provided, focusing particularly on the characteristics of each device for pulsed power applications. Two kinds of stacks for 10-kV pulses are developed with a high voltage capacitor charger in order to experimentally compare the characteristics of each device. Although the structure of each stack is similar, the number of power cells for the 10-kV pulse is different due to the device voltage rating. The power cell voltage for IGBT and MOSFET-based stacks is about 840 V and 560 V, respectively. Therefore, two types of transformer, with six secondary windings for the IGBT stack and nine secondary windings for the MOSFET stack, are also designed for storage capacitor charging. Moreover, the ease of varying the pulse repetition rate and the pulse width shows the advantages of the developed modulators in facilitating the measurement of device characteristics in different pulse output conditions. The experiments are performed with noninductive resistor loads, and the results of the comparison tests are discussed. In addition, the results prove that the developed modulator can be effectively used for high repetitive pulsed power applications.},

Using the interleaving technique, the output-current slew rate of the buck-based current source can be improved because of the paralleled inductors at the start of discharge. The proposed center-tapped energy-recovery scheme provides a major path for the inductor to release its stored energy to avoid high-voltage stress in the output terminal when the gap is in the high-impedance state. The energy stored in the inductor is recovered to the input capacitor, and can be reused for machining. The experimental results are provided as the verification of the high-output-current slew rate and the energy recovery when the gap is in high-impedance state.},

Several dc-dc converter topologies are considered and compared for the application and all the components in this design were selected based on current market availability. The 4- stage interleaved dc-dc converter topology is finally selected since it has a good performance to price ratio. The control algorithm based on the selected topology is illustrated and simulation results are presented and described.

The proposed control includes an inner voltage regulation loop that controls the active bouncer output voltage and an outer one that controls the klystron voltage. The primary side current and main capacitor voltage are included in the regulation loops to simplify the controllers. Simulations demonstrate that the strategy adopted allows to obtain a precision better than 0.1% on a 110 kV klystron.

The implementation of this technique is very simple and robust, employing only a small number of conventional inexpensive analog and logic components. It does not require trimmings or tunings, giving the control the capability to adjust itself to the different operating conditions.

  Abstract                 = {Since its first operation in 1972 at an energy of 800 MeV, the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster, which consists of four superimposed synchrotrons, has seen two upgrades: once to 1.0 GeV in 1988 and then to 1.4 GeV in 1999. During this time the main magnets of the machine have remained largely unchanged with small differences (1%) between the inner and outer gaps of the main bending magnet fields being compensated by trim power supplies. The future upgrade of the machine will demand to extract protons at an energy of 2.0 GeV and require almost double the original dipole field. At this field, due to saturation effects, the inner and outer gaps of the main dipole magnets will differ by up to 4%. This paper presents the design and implementation of a modification of the magnetic circuit strongly reducing these effects. We also discuss the results of experimental tests concerning the effects on field quality and eddy current transients, including the implications for the real-time magnetic field measurement system to control RF and power supplies.},

  Abstract                 = {A new 16-phase interleaved bidirectional dc/dc converter is developed featuring smaller input/output filters, faster dynamic response and lower device stress than conventional designs, for hybrid vehicle applications. The converter is connected between the ultracapacitor (UC) pack and the battery pack in a multisource energy storage system of a hybrid vehicle. Typically, multiphase interleaved converters require a current control loop in each phase to avoid imbalanced current between phases. This increases system cost and control complexity. In this paper, in order to minimize imbalance currents and remove the current control loop in each phase, the converter is designed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The high current ripple associated with DCM operation is then alleviated by interleaving. The design, construction, and testing of an experimental hardware prototype is presented, with the test results included. Finally, a novel soft switch topology for DCM operation is proposed for future research, to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS), or zero-current switching (ZCS) in all transitions.},

  Abstract                 = {The new generation of microprocessors has imposed more demanding design requirements for their power supplies, usually known as voltage regulator modules (VRM). The transient response of the converter is a critical design issue since tight output voltage regulation should be achieved at lower voltage values and higher current levels with faster transient slew rates. In order to meet the new specifications, multiphase interleaved synchronous buck converters are the most interesting solution from the VRM design viewpoint since this power topology allows increasing the current level minimizing the total equivalent inductance and the output capacitor. Regarding the converter control strategy, an existing control technique known as linear-nonlinear control improves the converter transient response with an easy saturation rule of the duty cycle since it is based on output voltage sensing. As a consequence, a reduction of the number of phases and the switching frequency of the multiphase VRM is obtained. This paper analyzes the impact of the reduction of the number of phases and switching frequency on the converter size in comparison with multiphase VRM with linear control strategy.},

Other advantages of this proposed topology are: (i) the perfect ripple-cancelation duty-cycle can be selected without increasing the component count, (ii) higher voltage gain compared to the traditional interleaved boost converter; this feature is highly desirable in renewable energy applications, (iii) the voltage gain can be easily increased with a diode-capacitor voltage multiplier.

Conventional multiphase circuits are supplied by a common source, and the goal is to distribute the processed power evenly between the phases. The best possible ripple cancellation can then be performed by shifting the switching operations of each phase by angles of even distance. However, in recent applications, such as maximum power point (MPP) tracking for solar photovoltaic (PV), multiple converters are supplied by sources that are often restricted to operate at different voltages and currents leading to asymmetric converter operation. To achieve improved ripple cancellation under these conditions, phase-shifting by uneven phase-angles is required. In this work, analytic formulas are derived to obtain suitable angles for phase-shifting. Simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, and a practical example of implementation with three dc-dc buck converters is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Self-tuned projected cross point control for power electronic converters is introduced. Projected cross point control (PCPC) combines the advantages of both analog and digital current-mode control techniques. Despite several advantages, accuracy of the PCPC method depends on the power stage inductor value. However, ferromagnetic characteristics of the inductor core material make the inductor measurement inaccurate. Furthermore, the inductor value is subject to change due to temperature variations or other environmental effects. To overcome the dependence of the PCPC method on the inductor value, self- tuned PCPC approach is introduced in this paper. Unlike the conventional PCPC scheme, self-tuned PCPC method has excellent robustness against the variations of the inductor value. Hence, the average inductor current accurately follows its reference regardless of aging and temperature effects on the power stage inductor. Furthermore, the addition of the self-tuning mechanism does not interfere with the dynamic performance of the conventional PCPC method. Analytical analysis and simulation results show the superior accuracy and transient response of the self-tuned projected cross point control technique.},

  Abstract                 = {By regulating the inverter output current every switching cycle, instantaneous current-sharing control strategies are usually employed in paralleled modular uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs). In this paper, virtual impedance, which is usually utilized in the droop method, is firstly introduced to the instantaneous current-sharing control strategy to achieve good load current-sharing performance. The instantaneous circulating current model of the paralleled system is developed and the circulating impedance is derived as well to clearly identify the intrinsic nature of unequal sharing of load current. By inserting the virtual impedance to the circulating impedance with the help of proper control strategy, good current-sharing capability can be obtained. The parallel inductor, e.g., coupled inductor, which is generally added at the output of each inverter to reduce the circulating current among modules, can be, therefore, eliminated, contributing to reduced weight, volume, and cost. In the meantime, the system output-voltage regulation performance, e.g., amplitude and waveform quality, is not affected by the introduction of the virtual impedance. The designation of the virtual impedance is provided and its implementation is simple but rather effective. Experimental results are also provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.},

The approach is based on the view of the multi-phase converter as a multi-level power D/A converter where the output voltage is sampled and the command is updated at the rate of Nfs, where fsis the per-phase switching frequency and N is the number of phases. In contrast to alternative approaches where the bandwidth is limited to a fraction of fs, we show that a bandwidth that scales with Nfsis achievable. A zero-error-bin approach, which is inherent to the digital controller implementation, is proposed to address the effects of phase-mismatches and sub-harmonic ripples on the stability of the wide-bandwidth controller. Simulation and experimental results are shown for a 16-phase synchronous buck converter operating at 1.56 MHz per-phase switching frequency.},
